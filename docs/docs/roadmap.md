# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

CodeGraphContext is an evolving tool. We believe in transparency about where we are and where we are going.

## 🟢 Currently Supported (Stable)

These features are live and battle-tested in version `0.1.41+`.

*   **Core Indexing:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C++, Ruby, PHP.

## 🚧 In Progress (Beta / Active Dev)

We are actively writing code for these right now.

*   **Interactive Visualizer:** A new web-based UI to explore the graph without Neo4j Browser.
